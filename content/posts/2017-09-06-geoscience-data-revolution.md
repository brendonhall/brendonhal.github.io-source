## Intro

The past year(s) have been an exciting time to be a geoscientist that can code.  
The ecosystem of software tools has reached a point where it is hard to keep up with the cool stuff coming out every week.
The emergence of data science as a discipline in its own right has changed our relationship with data.  
We have become explorers, artists, innovators, and entrepreneurs.
-something else about machine learning itself.

Communities have emerged
swung, hackathon
- many conversations on the impact on emerging ML and AI on geoscience and the exploration industry in particular
- due in large part to the successes in other industries
- geosciences are awash in data, but not always in a form suitable for machine learning
- list a few open geoscience resources
- what is required for this data to be useful?

## Background
- examples of data driving machine learning innovation
- ImageNet, refer to the article that goes over it's inception
- 2012 ImageNet challenge, Hinton etc launched the era of deep learning
- - cover what went into the development of this
- ecommerce, and the massive amounts of structured data that online services collect
- online services interest in innovating around data fueled Google's acquisition of Kaggle, the popular machine learning contest service.

## Evidence
- Kaggle provided inspiration for the first SEG machine learning contest held earlier in 2017
- This provides an example of how a simple, small but well curated dataset can fire the imaginations of geoscientists eager to develop their machine learning skills and spur an impressive amount of innovation.
- background on the dataset, 7 wells from kansas, etc.
- background on contest
- some of the innovations that were made, summarized by [Matt Hall](www.link.to.summary)
- estimate of the person hours put into innovating these models, for the investment put in

## What we can do

- of course, oil and gas companies can't make all their data open to the public
- I'm not advocating this and it isn't a good idea
- there is too much of it, and companies derive much value from their proprietary data
- there is a wealth of open geoscience data out there
- innovation in data science can happen with small, tidy, well curated datasets that have a purpose
- small/convenient - easy to obtain and quick to start using
- tidy - require a minimum of data cleaning to start using effectively.  More on this in the next post
- well curated - have documentation and tutorial articles for how to get started using the dataset
- If you're working on a project with open data, I encourage you to share your story; what you did to clean it up, how you structured it, and what you did with it.  
- Just as with the Kansas dataset, each of these datasets has a potential to spark a revolution on its on
- For the forseeable future, this blog will focus on sharing other open datasets that I have found and worked with.  I hope you will use them as part of your own projects, share your results, and join the discussion.
